# Engineers Code: Workshop for STEM Faculty
# Computing for Teaching and Learning in 2020

> If you are a teacher or interested in the design of the course, see the [meta](https://github.com/engineersCode/facultydev1/blob/gh-pages/meta.md) document.

## Description

This workshop is for STEM faculty who want to transform their teaching through integrating computing in the content, process, and design of their courses. 
The presenters are faculty members who have been using computing in their teaching for years, and are eager to share what we have learned. 
We also want to invite you to be part of a growing community of educators who discovered that modern tools, and new ways of collaborating, can supercharge teaching and learning. 

This is a sponsored workshop, and we are able to offer full travel support (including lodging and food) for 20 or more participants. 
Our sponsor is **Leidos, Inc.**, with additional support from the National Science Foundation through a grant to Prof. Lorena A. Barba.

> Apply for funding to participante via a simple form.

## Details

### Time and Location

The workshop will be held over three days on 25–27 March, 2020, at the George Washington University, in Washington, DC. 

### Funding

Funding is available to cover all costs of 20 or more participants (depending on actual travel costs), including: airfare and ground travel, lodging in Washington, and all meals. 

### Who is this for?

This workshop is for faculty at any stage of their career, who are teaching in science, engineering, or related technical fields. 
The only pre-requisite is that you are still curious and eager to learn, and that you want to empower your students to be successful in this technology driven world of today. 
You do not need to be an experienced programmer, but it helps if you have familiarity with technical computing. 
We will use Python and Jupyter as the programming language and environment.

## Content Overview

### Coding to learn

For years now, we've been hearing calls for “learning to code.” These calls may be well-intentioned and worthwhile, but they miss the point—what we need is _coding to learn_. 
Computing can be a medium to express ideas, inferences, arguments, or commentaries about the physical world (and, indeed, about social worlds). 
A lot has been said about "computational thinking" and how it might be taught. We'll have conversations about what computational thinking really means, its historical background, and the implications for STEM education. 

This portion of the workshop aims to inspire the rest of it by illustrating _"The Why"_ of our approach, philosophy, and methods to teach with computing.

### Teaching and Learning with Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is an open-source software project, including an ecosystem of tools for interactive computing. 
At the center of this ecosystem is the Jupyter Notebook, a file format that allows for the coexistence of regular text-based content, multi-media content, and computation with its live output. 
Since the prelude project, IPython Notebooks, STEM educators have found exciting opportunities to use computational notebooks to present technical materials for students to explore. 

Jupyter notebooks are also at the center of a broad initiative to integrate [data science in the undergraduate curriculum](https://data.berkeley.edu/news/coursefuture) at the University of California Berkeley. 
There, and elsewhere, instructional teams began developing various tools to  support the teaching mission, such as auto-graders. 
Many educators and community trendsetters began sharing educational content written as Jupyter notebooks, and this trend spread through technical conferences and coding bootcamps. 

In this workshop, we will coach participants in the use of the full Jupyter ecosystem for teaching and learning, including best practices learned and shared by the pioneers. 
This includes Jupyter itself, extensions for auto-grading assignment using Jupyter, infrastructure solutions for computing in the cloud, and platforms for sharing content with students and the public. 

This portion of the workshop will include a starter's tutorial on using Jupyter, and thus is adequate for the uninitiated. Some programming background is necessary, ideally in Python, but you don't have to be an expert. 

### Pedagogy of Open Education

When speaking about open education, most people think about open course-ware (OCW) or open educational resources (OER). 
Historically, the open-education movement was inspired by free and open-source software. 
This inspiration led to the drafting of standard public licenses for content, the Creative Commons licenses, and agreements on the [_open definition_](https://opendefinition.org):

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.

The predominant narratives about OER emphasize content, created to favor access, in an open model. 
But, unlike in open-source software, there's little reuse. 
This trend has missed important feature of free and open-source software: open development, networked collaboration, community, and a value-based framework.

> Openness is about the possibilities of communicating with other people. It’s not about stuff, what you do with stuff. It’s about what you do with each other 
>
>— Stephen Downes (2017) https://youtu.be/FPHYAFcUziA 

This portion of the workshop will help you answer the question: _"Why open education?"_ Open teaching and learning practices actively promote rich networks, lively communities, and fertile connections. That is the pedagogy of openness.
